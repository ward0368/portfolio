During the development of this website, I faced an overwhelming amount of challenges. Challenges that would take up my time and brain power, working me around the clock. The most prominent of these challenges were using boostrap grids, as they are quite complex if you do not fully understand them. Another challenge which took lots of my time was optimizing for different screen sizes, and changing layouts for screen sizes, this was by far the most time consuming part of the entire project. All of these problems were overcame the same way, with time, effort, perserverance and research. I asked questions, I researched online, I watched videos. Lots of work involving coding/web development is just research. You do what you know, and the rest you research until you know it. Every problem goes like this: Encounter, Solution Attempt, Fail, Research, Solution Attempt, Fail, Research, Solution Attempt, Success, Encounter. All of my problems were solved with this method and I plan on continueing to use it. I've learned that coding is always challenging, and there will always be new problems to face and overcome. It never gets easier, only smoother.
