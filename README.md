My Web Dev II Final

All Wireframes are used as inspiration and not direct copies of what the website should look like, the website itself will be changed where need be for functionality and responsiveness.

All stock images are from https://unsplash.com, the rest are by me.
(The high fidelity stock images were just placeholders, which is why they are different in the website final design.)
